## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details

### Architecture

```
ai-story-generator/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.py              # Main Streamlit application
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env                # Environment variables (API key)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt    # Python dependencies
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md          # This file
```

### Dependencies

- **streamlit**: Web app framework
- **requests**: HTTP requests for Gemini API
- **python-dotenv**: Environment variable management
- **os**: Operating system interface

### API Integration

The app uses Google's Gemini 1.5 Flash model via REST API:
- **Endpoint**: `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-1.5-flash:generateContent`
- **Method**: POST
- **Authentication**: API key parameter
- **Response Format**: JSON with generated content

### Customization Options

The story generation can be customized with:

```python
creativity_settings = {
    "creative": {"temperature": 0.9, "top_p": 0.8},
    "balanced": {"temperature": 0.7, "top_p": 0.8},
    "focused": {"temperature": 0.3, "top_p": 0.8}
}
```

## API Configuration

### Gemini API Settings

- **Model**: `gemini-1.5-flash`
- **Max Output Tokens**: 300 (150-250 word stories)
- **Temperature**: 0.3-0.9 (based on creativity level)
- **Top P**: 0.8 (consistent across all levels)
- **Timeout**: 30 seconds

### Error Handling

The app handles common API errors:
- `401`: Invalid API key
- `403`: Access forbidden
- `404`: Model not found
- `429`: Rate limit exceeded
- Timeout errors
- Network connectivity issues

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. "API key not found in environment variables"**
- Ensure your `.env` file is in the project root
- Check that the API key is correctly formatted: `GEMINI_API_KEY=AIza...`
- Restart the Streamlit app after creating the `.env` file

**2. "Invalid API key (401)"**
- Verify your API key is correct and hasn't expired
- Make sure you copied the complete key from Google AI Studio

**3. "Rate limit exceeded (429)"**
- Wait a few minutes before trying again
- Google AI Studio has generous free tier limits, but they do exist

**4. Stories not generating**
- Check your internet connection
- Try a simpler prompt first
- Verify the API key is working with the built-in test feature

### Performance Tips

- Keep prompts concise but descriptive (1-2 sentences work best)
- Use the "Focused" creativity setting for more consistent results
- Try different genre combinations for unique stories

## Customization

### Styling

The app uses extensive CSS customization with:
- Custom fonts (Inter, Poppins)
- Glassmorphism effects
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Responsive design for mobile devices
- Custom color scheme with gradients

### Adding New Features

Easy extension points:
- Add new genres in the `genre_hint` selectbox
- Modify creativity settings in `creativity_settings`
- Add new sample prompts in the `sample_prompts` dictionary
- Customize the story length by changing `maxOutputTokens`
